 Thread Synchronization primitives namely lock, monitors & semaphores for Multithreaded Theatre Simulation.
 Multiprogramming, System Calls, Virtual Memory to tackle page fault (using TLB, IPT, page tables & swap file).
 Distributed System component, making multiple Nachos servers to co-ordinate. Developed different RPCs, enabling servers to provide synchronization to clients (for accessing distributed resources).
